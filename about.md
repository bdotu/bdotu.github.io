>*“Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! [...] From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do – now.” - **Epictetus, The Art of Living***

Hello.

Welcome to my personal website. My name is Bright; and I enjoy reading, coding, writing, video games, movies, and learning new things. That's about all I can think of whenever I encounter an *about me*. Anything else feels indulgent and a little unnecessary. If you care to find out more about me, feel free to email me and I will respond to the best of my abilities.

On the quote above, it is a way of keeping myself accountable. In my mind, if people are reading it and thinking I live by it, then surely, it is but my responsibility to abide by it. The quote is how I strive to live my life.

I'm always open for a chat about anything and everything. <a href="mailto:{{ site.myemail }}" id="email">Email me</a>.
