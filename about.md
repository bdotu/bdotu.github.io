>*“Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! [...] From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do – now.” - **Epictetus, The Art of Living***

Hello.

Welcome to my personal website. My name is Bright; and I enjoy reading, coding, writing, video games, movies, and learning new things. Saying anything else seems indulgent and a little unnecessary. Feel free to email me if you care to know more about me. I will do my best to respond.

On the quote above, it is a way of keeping myself accountable. I put it there for people to read. And because of that, I feel obligated to abide by it. The quote is how I strive to live my life.

I'm always open for a chat about anything and everything. <a href="mailto:{{ site.myemail }}" id="email">Email me</a>.
